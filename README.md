# Coding-Quiz

The application is a basic multiple choice quiz that features several options based on what is clicked. There are 5 questions, each featuring custom color, messaging based on correct or wrong answer selected, and a timer degredation of 10 seconds if the user clicks on an incorrect answer. Additionally, there is a view high scores section which features the high scores of the current session. 

For each question, there are 4 options to choose from. There is a hover color of light red to signify the option the user is currently over, and upon clicking the correct option the answer either stays as red or blue (if correctly choosing). Once the corresponding messaging appears for each question, there is a "Next Question" button which will advance to the next question. When the user completes the quiz, there is a "Try Again" button. This will bring the user back to the start of the quiz and will prompt a restart of the timer. Should the user decide to view high scores from the session, by clicking on the "View High Scores" button, high scores can be viewed. The option to try again is still presented, as is the clear scores option.

At the time of submission, setting up local storage and clearing from local storage(clear scores) have not been successfully implemented. There is pseudocoding to illustrate what needs to be done. Assignment will be resubmitted once this step is completed.
